3. Describe the difficulties you faced (if any) while working on the challenge and how you tackled them.
My primary difficulty was with css formatting. I really haven't done frontend all too much, especially stylesheeting, so my css code really isn't that clean, and it probably would have been easier to learn a framework like Bootstrap. I look forward to developing my skills in this regard more at the DP.
